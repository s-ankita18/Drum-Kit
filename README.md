This Drum Kit project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on the on-screen buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a fun way to experiment with different drum sounds.

### How It Works
**Button Press Detection**:   The application listens for clicks on each drum button and triggers the corresponding sound and animation.
**Key Press Detection**:   It also listens for specific key presses and triggers the same sound and animation as the corresponding button.
**Sound Playback**:   Each drum sound is played using the Audio object in JavaScript, which loads and plays the sound files stored in the project.
**Button Animation**: When a drum button is activated (either by click or key press), a short animation is applied to provide visual feedback, which is then removed after a brief delay.
