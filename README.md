This Drum Kit project is an interactive web-based application that allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on the on-screen buttons or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it provides a fun way to experiment with different drum sounds.

### How It Works

**Button Press Detection**:  
The application listens for clicks on each drum button and triggers the corresponding sound and animation. 

**Key Press Detection**:  
It also listens for specific key presses and triggers the same sound and animation as the corresponding button.

**Sound Playback**:  
Each drum sound is played using the Audio object in JavaScript, which loads and plays the sound files stored in the project.  

**Button Animation**:  
When a drum button is activated (either by click or key press), a short animation is applied to provide visual feedback, which is then removed after a brief delay.
